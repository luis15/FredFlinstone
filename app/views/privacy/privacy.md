Privacy Policy

This document outlines Banco de Bits Ltda.'s respect for your
personal privacy as a user of the service and it's commitment to protect
it.

Website Visitors

Like most website operators,
BdeB collects non-personally-identifying information of
the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as
the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
time of each visitor request. BdeB purpose in collecting
non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
BdeB’s visitors use its website. From time to time,
BdeB may release non-personally-identifying information
in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
its website. BdeB also collects potentially
personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
for logged in users. BdeB only discloses logged in user
IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
personally-identifying information as described below. Gathering of
Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to
BdeB’s website choose to interact with
BdeB in ways that require BdeB to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
that BdeB gathers depends on the nature of the
interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account to
provide a username, fullname and email address. Those who engage in
transactions with BdeB are asked to provide additional
information, including as necessary the personal and financial
information required to process those transactions. In each case,
BdeB collects such information only insofar as is
necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s
interaction with BdeB. BdeB does not
disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics

BdeB may collect statistics about
the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance,
BdeB may monitor the most popular accounts on the site
or use spam screening software to help identify spam.
BdeB may display this information publicly or provide it
to others. However, BdeB does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

BdeB discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
information in order to process it on BdeB’s behalf or
to provide services available at BdeB’s websites, and
(ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
outside of your home country; by using BdeB’s websites,
you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
BdeB will not rent or sell potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
as described above, BdeB discloses potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in
response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
when BdeB believes in good faith that disclosure is
reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
BdeB, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
registered user of BdeB and have supplied your email
address, BdeB may occasionally send you an email to tell
you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
date with what’s going on with BdeB and our products. We
primarily use our various products to communicate this type of
information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If
you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
users. BdeB takes all measures reasonably necessary to
protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction
of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information.

Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a
website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser
provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
BdeB uses cookies to help BdeB identify
and track visitors, their usage of BdeB website, and
their website access preferences. BdeB visitors who do
not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
browsers to refuse cookies before using BdeB’s websites,
with the drawback that certain features of BdeB’s
websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Business Transfers

If BdeB, or substantially
all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that
BdeB goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired
by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and
that any acquirer of BdeB may continue to use your
personal information as set forth in this policy.

Ads

Ads appearing
on any of our pages may be delivered to users by advertising partners,
who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your
computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
information about you or others who use your computer. This information
allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by BdeB and
does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be
minor, BdeB may change its Privacy Policy from time to
time, and in BdeB’s sole discretion.
BdeB encourages visitors to frequently check this page
for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have an account, you
should also check your dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your
continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will
constitute your acceptance of such change. \*Originally published by
