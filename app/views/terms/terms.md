much control and ownership over what goes on your site as possible and
encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be responsible in
what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited
items listed below appear on your site or get linked to from your site
(things like spam, viruses, or hate content).

BdeB website and all content, services and products
available at or through the website (taken together, the Website). The

    comment on an account, post material to the Website, post links on

    material available by means of the Website (any such material,
    “Content”), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any
    harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of
    whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio
    file, a video file, or computer software. By making Content
    available, you represent and warrant that:

    -   the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not

        third party;

        you have either (i) received permission from your employer to
